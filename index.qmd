# Why fractals are so uselful for Geographers?


:::{.epigraph}
> [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by Edward Tufte is a seminal text in the field of data visualization. On page 40, the text walks the reader through the complexity of a graphic by Charles Minard[^map] that depicts Napoleon's disastrous military campaign in Russia. An excerpt from that chapter is printed below, with permission[^text].
:::

An especially effective device for enhancing the explanatory power of time-series displays is to add spatial dimensions to the design of the graphic, so that the data are moving over space (in two or three dimensions) as well as over time. Three excellent space-time-story graphics illustrate here how multivariate complexity can be subtly integrated into graphical architecture, integrated so gently and unobtrusively that viewers are hardly aware that they are looking into a world of four or five dimensions. Occasionally graphics are belligerently multivariate, advertising the technique rather than the data. But not these three.

The first is the classic of Charles Joseph Minard (1781-1870), the French engineer, which shows the terrible fate of Napoleon's army in Russia. Described by E. J. Marey as seeming to defy the pen of the historian by its brutal eloquence, 12 this combination of data map and time-series, drawn in 1869, portrays a sequence of devastating losses suffered in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. @cr-map

Beginning at left on the Polish-Russian border near the Niemen River, the thick tan flow-line shows the size of the Grand Army (422,000) as it invaded Russia in June 1812. [@cr-map]{pan-to="0%,0%" scale-by="3"}

The width of this band indicates the size of the army at each place on the map.

In September, the army reached Moscow, which was by then sacked and deserted, with 100,000 men. [@cr-map]{pan-to="0%, 0%" scale-by="9"}


the size of the army,

its location on a two-dimensional surface,

direction of the army's movement,

and temperature on various dates during the retreat from Moscow.

It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.[@cr-map]{pan-to="0%,0%" scale-by="27"}
